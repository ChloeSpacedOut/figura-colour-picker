# figura-colour-picker
A colour picker addon, that when added to your avatar, allows you to easily select a colour from a GUI. This includes support for typing, copying, and pasting HEX codes, for even easier colour customisation. To toggle the colour picker, run `colourPicker.toggle(toggleValue)` in your script, and you can modify or add the function `colourPicker.onSubmit(colour)` (by defualt in `colourPicker/core.lua`) to output the chosen colour, and incorporate it into your avatar. The colour picker should work at all GUI scales and resolutions, and only takes around 5kb of space.
